# 🧱 Dataset: Midrex-Alpha Reactor Operation

## 📘 Overview
This dataset contains **hourly records for two weeks** of simulated operation of a **Midrex-type direct reduction reactor**, used to produce **Direct Reduced Iron (DRI)** from iron ore pellets.

The **Midrex process** employs **reformed natural gas**, rich in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H₂), as the reducing agent.  
The hot reducing gas flows **counter-current** to the descending iron pellets.  
During the process, oxygen is removed from the iron oxides, producing **solid metallic iron** without melting.

This synthetic dataset represents operational data from the fictional plant **MIDREX-Alpha**, designed for research, education, and industrial data analytics.
